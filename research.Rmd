My PhD research was completed under the supervision of Terry Speed in the 
Statistics Department at UC Berkeley.  My thesis focused on the analysis of 
high-throughput genomics data, with a particular emphasis on the then-emerging high-throughput DNA sequencing data.  Additional projects included applied work
in statistical genetics.

For my postdoc, I extended my work in statistical genetics to include methods 
development for analysis of imputed data in large trio datasets and methods for 
reducing test multiplicity in case-control settings by leveraging marker 
correlation structure.

In the years since, I have built on consistent collaborations inside and outside
the Department of Biostatistics, with applied work on oral cleft disorders, cardiovascular
disease, schizophrenia and asthma, and methods development for DNA methylation data
and variant calling.
