My PhD research was completed under the supervision of Terry Speed in the 
Statistics Department at UC Berkeley.  My thesis focused on the analysis of 
high-throughput genomics data, with a particular emphasis on the then-emerging high-throughput DNA sequencing data.  Additional projects included applied work
in statistical genetics.

For my postdoc, I extended my work in statistical genetics to include methods 
development for analysis of imputed data in large trio datasets and methods for 
reducing test multiplicity in case-control settings by leveraging marker 
correlation structure.

I have also continued my work on high-throughput sequencing to include an 
investigation of biases in variant detection due to technical artifacts and 
have worked collaboratively on investigating optimal analysis methods for deep 
targeted resequencing data.

Expanding into the field of epigenetics, I have worked on analysis methods for 
the new high-throughput methylation array from Illumina.
