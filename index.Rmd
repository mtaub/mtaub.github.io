I am an Associate Scientist in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins 
University. I completed my postdoc at Hopkins under the mentorship of 
[Rafael Irizarry](http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/) and 
[Ingo Ruczinski](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~iruczins/).  I was 
in the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley under the supervision of 
[Terry Speed](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~terry/) for my graduate studies.

I work on methods development in statistical genetics and on analysis problems 
for high-throughput genomics data, including methylation array data, RNA-seq data and
DNA sequencing data.  I collaborate with scientists working to understand the genetics
and genomics of oral cleft disorders, cardiovascular disease and asthma, among other things.

I teach a large undergraduate biostatistics course, mainly to students studying public
health, and a couple of smaller courses on R programming and data analysis. 

A copy of my CV is available
[here](taub_cv.pdf).
